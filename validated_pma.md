## Enhanced Pest Management Advice: Wheat Aphids

This report enhances the existing Pest Management Advice (PMA) for wheat aphids, addressing identified knowledge gaps.

### 1. Identification

*   **Gap:** Specificity of pest identification within the broader pest category (e.g., specific aphid species and their biotypes affecting wheat).
*   **Justification:** Knowing the specific species allows for more targeted control measures.
*   **Query Used:** "wheat aphids species identification guide"
*   **Source:** University of California Agriculture and Natural Resources, Kansas State University Extension, CABI Compendium, Bugwood Images

**Updated Section 1. Identification:**

*   **Pest Name:** Wheat Aphids
*   **Scientific Name:** Several aphid species can infest wheat, including:
    *   *Schizaphis graminum* (Greenbug): Pale green with a dark green stripe down the back. Known for its biotypes that can overcome plant resistance.
    *   *Sitobion avenae* (English grain aphid): Green to yellowish-green, with long antennae. Commonly found on the heads of wheat.
    *   *Rhopalosiphum padi* (Bird cherry-oat aphid): Olive-green to blackish-green, often found on leaves and stems.
    *   *Metopolophium dirhodum* (Rose-grass aphid): Pale green to yellow-green, found on the upper leaves.
*   **Crop(s) Affected:** Wheat, Barley, other small grains, grasses
*   **Stage(s) of Crop Affected:** Seedling, Vegetative, Reproductive (especially during heading and grain fill)
*   **Description of Pest:**
    *   **Greenbug:** Small (1/16 inch), pale green aphids with a characteristic dark green stripe down the center of their back. They are typically found on the lower parts of the plant, often near the base of the leaves or on the stem.
    *   **English grain aphid:** Larger than greenbugs (1/8 inch), green to yellowish-green in color. They have long antennae that extend beyond their body. These aphids are commonly found on the heads of wheat plants, feeding directly on the developing grains.
    *   **Bird cherry-oat aphid:** Small to medium-sized (1/16 - 1/8 inch), olive-green to blackish-green aphids. They can be found on both the leaves and stems of wheat plants.
    *   **Rose-grass aphid:** Small (1/16 inch), pale green to yellow-green aphids. They are typically found on the upper leaves of the plant.
*   **Life Cycle:** Aphids have a complex life cycle, often involving both sexual and asexual reproduction (parthenogenesis). In many regions, they overwinter as eggs on grasses or volunteer wheat. Winged aphids (alates) migrate to wheat fields in the spring. They reproduce rapidly, with multiple generations per year. Nymphs resemble adults but are smaller and wingless. The duration of each stage depends on temperature, but a generation can be completed in as little as a week under favorable conditions. Greenbugs can have 15-20 generations per year.
*   **Distinguishing features from similar pests/diseases:**
    *   **Greenbug:** The dark green stripe on the back is a key identifying feature.
    *   **English grain aphid:** Distinguished by its long antennae and preference for feeding on the grain heads.
    *   **Bird cherry-oat aphid:** Darker coloration compared to other wheat aphids.
    *   Unlike leafhoppers, aphids are slow-moving and tend to cluster. Unlike nutrient deficiencies, aphid infestations are characterized by the presence of the insects themselves and often accompanied by honeydew and sooty mold. Damage from Russian wheat aphid can resemble some diseases, but the aphids themselves will be present.

### 2. Monitoring and Thresholds

*   **Gap:** Lack of precision in economic thresholds based on crop growth stage and environmental conditions; absence of action thresholds based on natural enemy presence.
*   **Justification:** Thresholds should be dynamic.
*   **Query Used:** "wheat aphid economic threshold AND crop stage AND natural enemies"
*   **Source:** Regional Pest Management Handbooks, Journal of Economic Entomology, Crop Protection Journal

**Updated Section 2. Monitoring and Thresholds:**

*   **Monitoring Methods:** Visually inspect plants weekly, paying close attention to new growth, undersides of leaves, and developing grain heads. Use a sweep net to sample for mobile pests in larger fields. Yellow sticky traps can be used to monitor aphid populations, especially alates (winged forms) during migration periods. Focus monitoring efforts on areas of the field with a history of aphid problems or areas near grassy borders.
*   **Economic Thresholds:** Economic thresholds vary depending on the aphid species, crop growth stage, environmental conditions, and presence of natural enemies. General guidelines:
    *   **Seedling Stage:** Initiate control measures when aphid populations exceed 50 aphids per tiller or 10% of plants are infested.
    *   **Vegetative Stage (before heading):** Initiate control measures when aphid populations exceed 5-10 aphids per tiller.
    *   **Heading and Grain Fill:** A higher threshold of 10-15 aphids per head may be acceptable if the crop is otherwise healthy and environmental conditions are favorable for plant growth.
*   **Factors Influencing Thresholds:**
    *   **Crop Variety:** Susceptible varieties have lower thresholds.
    *   **Crop Stage:** Seedlings are most vulnerable.
    *   **Environmental Conditions:** Drought stress lowers thresholds. High temperatures can reduce aphid populations but also stress the crop.
    *   **Natural Enemy Presence:** Presence of significant natural enemy populations (lady beetles, lacewings, parasitic wasps) can increase thresholds. Consider delaying treatment if natural enemies are abundant and actively feeding on aphids. A suggested action threshold adjustment is to increase the aphid density threshold by 25-50% if natural enemies are present in significant numbers (e.g., more than one lady beetle larva or adult per meter of row).
    *   **Grain Prices:** Higher grain prices may justify lower thresholds.
    *   **Specific Aphid Species**: Greenbugs have lower thresholds due to their higher damage potential.

### 3. Damage

*   **Gap:** Quantification of yield loss and quality reduction under varying infestation levels and environmental conditions. Specific data on virus transmission rates.
*   **Justification:** Precise data needed for accurate economic decision-making.
*   **Query Used:** "wheat aphid yield loss assessment AND virus transmission"
*   **Source:** Plant Disease Journal, USDA Agricultural Research Service (ARS) publications, FAO reports on crop pests

**Updated Section 3. Damage:**

*   **Type of Damage:** Aphids feed by sucking sap from plants, causing stunted growth, leaf curling, yellowing (chlorosis), and reduced yield. They inject toxins while feeding. They also excrete honeydew, which can lead to sooty mold growth, hindering photosynthesis. Greenbugs inject a toxin that causes significant damage.
*   **Symptoms:** Stunted growth, curled or yellowed leaves, honeydew, sooty mold, presence of aphids, reduced tillering. Greenbug feeding can cause reddish or yellowish spots on leaves.
*   **Potential Yield Loss:** Yield loss varies depending on aphid species, infestation level, crop stage, and environmental conditions.
    *   Heavy aphid infestations can reduce wheat yields by up to 30-40% or even higher in severe cases, especially during the seedling and early vegetative stages.
    *   Studies have shown that even moderate aphid populations (e.g., 5-10 aphids per tiller during vegetative growth) can result in yield losses of 5-10%.
    *   Yield losses are typically higher under drought stress.
*   **Indirect Damage:** Aphids can transmit several plant viruses, including:
    *   Barley Yellow Dwarf Virus (BYDV): Transmitted by several aphid species, including *Rhopalosiphum padi* and *Sitobion avenae*. Can cause significant yield losses. Transmission rates vary depending on the aphid species and virus strain, but can be as high as 50-80% under favorable conditions.
    *   Cereal Yellow Dwarf Virus (CYDV)
    *   Wheat streak mosaic virus (transmitted by the wheat curl mite, but aphid feeding can weaken plants and make them more susceptible).
*   **Impact on Crop Quality:**
    *   Honeydew contamination can reduce the marketability of grain.
    *   Sooty mold can affect photosynthesis and grain fill, reducing grain weight and quality.
    *   Virus infections can reduce grain protein content.

### 4. Cultural Control

*   **Gap:** Specific recommendations on cover cropping strategies to disrupt pest cycles; detailed information on the impact of tillage practices.
*   **Justification:** Cover cropping and tillage can significantly influence pest populations.
*   **Query Used:** "wheat aphid cover crops AND tillage"
*   **Source:** SARE (Sustainable Agriculture Research & Education), eXtension, No-Till Farmer magazine

**Updated Section 4. Cultural Control:**

*   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate wheat with non-host crops such as legumes (e.g., soybeans, alfalfa), oilseeds (e.g., canola, sunflower), or corn. Avoid planting wheat after other small grains or grasses, as these can serve as alternate hosts for aphids.
*   **Variety Selection:** Use aphid-resistant wheat varieties when available. Check with your local extension service or seed supplier for recommendations on resistant varieties adapted to your region.
*   **Planting Date:** Adjust planting date to avoid peak aphid migration periods in the fall. Delayed planting can reduce aphid infestations, but may also reduce yield potential. Consider the trade-off between pest pressure and yield potential.
*   **Fertilization:** Maintain balanced soil fertility based on soil test recommendations. Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization, which can increase aphid populations. Ensure adequate levels of phosphorus and potassium to promote healthy plant growth and increase resistance to pests.
*   **Irrigation:** Avoid water stress, which can make plants more susceptible to aphid attack. Irrigate as needed to maintain adequate soil moisture levels, especially during critical growth stages.
*   **Sanitation:** Remove weeds and crop residue that can harbor aphids. Control volunteer wheat and grassy weeds in and around fields.
*   **Cover Cropping:**
    *   **Benefits:** Cover crops can disrupt aphid life cycles, provide habitat for natural enemies, and improve soil health.
    *   **Recommended Cover Crops:**
        *   Legumes (e.g., clover, vetch): Can fix nitrogen in the soil and provide habitat for beneficial insects. Avoid planting legumes immediately before wheat if nitrogen levels are already high.
        *   Oats: Can suppress weed growth and provide a quick-growing cover crop.
        *   Mixtures: A mixture of cover crops can provide multiple benefits.
    *   **Timing:** Plant cover crops after wheat harvest or before planting wheat, depending on the cover crop species and your cropping system. Terminate cover crops before they become a weed problem or compete with the wheat crop for resources.
*   **Tillage:**
    *   **No-Till:** No-till farming can conserve soil moisture and reduce soil erosion. However, it may also increase aphid populations in some cases, as it can provide a more stable habitat for aphids and other pests.
    *   **Conventional Tillage:** Conventional tillage can disrupt aphid life cycles and reduce aphid populations. However, it can also have negative impacts on soil health.
    *   **Considerations:** The impact of tillage on aphid populations depends on several factors, including the type of tillage, the timing of tillage, and the environmental conditions. Monitor aphid populations closely and adjust tillage practices as needed.

### 5. Biological Control

*   **Gap:** In-depth information on the effectiveness of specific natural enemies under field conditions; guidance on creating habitat to support natural enemy populations.
*   **Justification:** Understanding the efficacy of natural enemies and how to enhance their populations is critical for sustainable pest management.
*   **Query Used:** "wheat aphid biological control AND habitat enhancement"
*   **Source:** Biological Control Journal, IOBC (International Organization for Biological Control), Entomological Society of America

**Updated Section 5. Biological Control:**

*   **Natural Enemies:**
    *   **Predators:**
        *   Lady beetles (e.g., *Hippodamia convergens*, *Coccinella septempunctata*): Both adults and larvae feed on aphids.
        *   Lacewings (e.g., *Chrysoperla carnea*): Larvae are voracious aphid predators.
        *   Syrphid flies (hoverflies): Larvae feed on aphids.
        *   Minute pirate bugs (*Orius* spp.): Feed on aphids and other small insects.
    *   **Parasitoids:**
        *   Parasitic wasps (e.g., *Aphidius* spp., *Aphelinus* spp.): Lay their eggs inside aphids, killing them. Aphid mummies (parasitized aphids) are a sign of parasitoid activity.
    *   **Pathogens:**
        *   Fungal pathogens (e.g., *Beauveria bassiana*, *Metarhizium anisopliae*): Can infect and kill aphids, especially under humid conditions.
*   **Conservation Strategies:**
    *   **Provide Habitat:** Plant flowering plants to provide nectar and pollen for beneficial insects. Choose plants that bloom at different times of the season to provide a continuous food source. Examples include:
        *   Clovers
        *   Alfalfa
        *   Sunflowers
        *   Yarrow
        *   Dill
        *   Fennel
    *   **Reduce or Eliminate Broad-Spectrum Insecticide Applications:** Broad-spectrum insecticides can kill beneficial insects as well as aphids. Use selective insecticides or apply insecticides only when economic thresholds are reached.
    *   **Provide Water:** Provide a source of water for beneficial insects, especially during dry periods.
    *   **Minimize Tillage:** Reduced tillage can help conserve soil-dwelling natural enemies.
*   **Augmentation:**
    *   **Purchase and Release:** Purchase and release lady beetles, lacewings, or parasitic wasps. This can be effective in certain situations, but it is important to choose the right species and release them at the right time.
    *   **Considerations:** Augmentation can be expensive and may not always be effective. It is important to carefully evaluate the costs and benefits before implementing an augmentation program.
*   **Effectiveness Under Field Conditions:** The effectiveness of natural enemies depends on several factors, including the species of natural enemy, the aphid density, the environmental conditions, and the availability of alternative food sources. Studies have shown that natural enemies can significantly reduce aphid populations under field conditions, but their effectiveness can vary.

### 6. Chemical Control

*   **Gap:** Up-to-date information on insecticide resistance; efficacy data for alternative insecticides (e.g., biopesticides); impact of insecticides on non-target organisms.
*   **Justification:** Resistance management and environmental stewardship require current information.
*   **Query Used:** "wheat aphid insecticide resistance AND biopesticides AND non-target effects"
*   **Source:** IRAC (Insecticide Resistance Action Committee), Pesticide Action Network, Journal of Pest Science

            *   Formulation: [e.g., Emulsifiable Concentrate]
            *   Application Rate: [See Label]

    **Important Note:** *Always check local regulations and product labels for approved uses and application rates. Rotate insecticide classes to prevent resistance development.*
*   **Timing of Application:** Apply insecticides when aphid populations reach economic thresholds, typically before heading. Consider the impact on beneficial insects when making treatment decisions.
*   **Application Methods:** Apply foliar sprays using sufficient water volume to ensure thorough coverage. Use appropriate nozzle types and spray pressure to minimize drift.
*   **Resistance Management:**
    *   **Rotate Insecticide Classes:** Rotate insecticide classes with different modes of action (IRAC codes). Avoid repeated use of the same insecticide or insecticide class.
    *   **Use Integrated Pest Management Practices:** Use cultural practices, biological control, and other non-chemical methods to reduce reliance on insecticides.
    *   **Monitor Aphid Populations:** Monitor aphid populations regularly to detect early signs of resistance.
    *   **Use Full Label Rates:** Use the full label rate of insecticide to ensure adequate control.
*   **Safety Precautions:** Wear appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE), such as gloves, long sleeves, and a respirator. Follow all label instructions.
*   **Environmental Considerations:** Avoid spraying during windy conditions or when pollinators are active. Use insecticides that are less toxic to beneficial insects. Consider using biopesticides as an alternative to synthetic insecticides.
*   **Insecticide Resistance:** Resistance to pyrethroid insecticides has been reported in some aphid populations. Monitor insecticide efficacy and rotate insecticide classes to prevent resistance development. Consult with your local extension service or crop advisor for information on insecticide resistance in your area.

### 7. Other Control Methods

*   **Gap:** Efficacy and cost-effectiveness of physical barriers (e.g., row covers, reflective mulches) for large-scale wheat production.
*   **Justification:** Exploring alternative control methods can broaden the IPM toolbox.
*   **Query Used:** "wheat aphid physical barriers AND cost effectiveness"
*   **Source:** Agricultural Engineering Journals, NCERA-101 Committee on Controlled Environment Technology and Use, Appropriate Technology Transfer for Rural Areas (ATTRA)

**Updated Section 7. Other Control Methods:**

*   **Physical Barriers:**
    *   **Row Covers:** Row covers can protect seedlings from aphid infestations, but they are not practical for large-scale wheat production due to cost and logistical challenges.
    *   **Reflective Mulches:** Reflective mulches can repel aphids, but they are also not practical for large-scale wheat production due to cost and logistical challenges.
*   **Traps:**
     * Yellow sticky traps can be used to monitor aphid populations, but they are not effective for controlling aphid populations on a large scale.
*   **Border Traps:** Planting a more attractive host plant around the perimeter of the wheat field to attract aphids away from the main crop. This can be difficult to manage and may not be effective in all situations.

### 8. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy

*   **Gap:** Lack of specific decision-making criteria that integrate multiple factors (pest density, natural enemy presence, crop stage, weather conditions, economic factors).
*   **Justification:** A comprehensive decision-making framework is crucial for effective IPM implementation.
*   **Query Used:** "integrated pest management decision support system wheat aphids"
*   **Source:** IPM Centers, Decision Support System websites, Expert systems journals

**Updated Section 8. Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategy:**

*   **Summary of IPM Approach:** Monitor aphid populations regularly. Use cultural practices such as crop rotation and resistant varieties. Conserve natural enemies by providing habitat and avoiding broad-spectrum insecticides. Apply insecticides only when economic thresholds are reached and rotate insecticide classes to prevent resistance.
*   **Decision-Making Flowchart:**
    *   **Start:** Monitor field for aphids weekly.
    *   **Is pest present?**
        *   **No:** Continue monitoring.
        *   **Yes:** Identify aphid species (Greenbug, English grain aphid, etc.) and estimate aphid density (aphids per tiller or head). Assess the presence and abundance of natural enemies (lady beetles, lacewings, parasitic wasps). Note crop growth stage and weather conditions (especially drought stress). Check current grain prices.
    *   **Is aphid density above economic threshold, *adjusted for crop stage, natural enemy presence and environmental conditions*?**
        *   **No:** Continue monitoring. Re-evaluate in 3-5 days.
        *   **Yes:** Consider control options (biological, chemical, or a combination).
    *   **Select control option based on factors such as:**
        *   **Cost:** Compare the cost of different control options.
        *   **Environmental Impact:** Choose options that are less harmful to the environment and beneficial insects.
        *   **Resistance Risk:** Rotate insecticide classes to prevent resistance development.
        *   **Crop Stage:** Consider the crop stage when selecting a control option. Some insecticides may not be safe to use during certain growth stages.
        *   **Natural Enemy Impact**: Select insecticides with minimal impact on beneficial insect populations, or apply them in a way to minimize harm (e.g., edge treatments, spot treatments).
    *   **Implement control measures.**
    *   **Evaluate effectiveness of control measures 3-7 days after application.**
        *   If control is not satisfactory, re-evaluate the situation and consider alternative control options.
    *   **Adjust IPM strategy as needed.**
    *   **Record Keeping:** Maintain accurate records of scouting data, control measures applied, and results.

### 9. Record Keeping

*   **Importance of Record Keeping:** Keep accurate records of pest monitoring, control measures, and results to improve future pest management decisions.
*   **Types of Records to Keep:** Scouting records (dates, locations, aphid counts, natural enemy counts), pesticide application records (date, time, product, rate, weather conditions), yield data, and weather data.
