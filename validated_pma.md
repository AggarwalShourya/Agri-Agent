### Pest Management Advice: Beet Cyst Nematode in Sugar Beet Seedlings

**Scenario Overview:**

*   Beet Cyst Nematode (BCN), *Heterodera schachtii*, infestation in sugar beet seedlings.
*   Location: Lincolnshire, UK.
*   Time: April.
*   Conditions: 15Â°C, overcast, 75% humidity, 20mm precipitation.
*   Severity: 1 egg and larvae per gram of soil.

**Identification:**

*   Visual: Stunted, yellowing plants, patchy growth. Microscopic examination of roots reveals small, lemon-shaped cysts (initially white/yellow, maturing to brown) attached to the roots.
*   Soil Sampling: Laboratory analysis confirms presence and density of BCN eggs and larvae.

**Monitoring & Thresholds:**

*   **Monitoring:** Regular soil sampling, particularly in fields with a history of BCN. Observe seedlings for symptoms.
*   **Economic Threshold:** Current UK guidelines suggest that an egg count of >20 eggs per gram of soil requires immediate attention. *However, this threshold may not be appropriate for seedlings, which are more vulnerable. Seedling-specific thresholds require further research.* Preventative action is warranted given seedling stage, even with a low egg count of 1 egg/gram.
*   **Pest Management Decision (PMD):** *True* - Intervention is recommended due to the presence of nematodes in seedlings.

**Damage:**

*   BCN larvae invade roots, disrupting water and nutrient uptake.
*   Reduced plant vigor, stunted growth, and yield losses.
*   Severe infestations can cause seedling death.

**IPM Strategies:**

*   **Preventative:**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Avoid short rotations with susceptible crops (e.g., sugar beet, oilseed rape, brassicas). Include non-host crops (e.g., cereals, potatoes) for at least three years.
    *   **Resistant Varieties:** Use BCN-resistant sugar beet varieties where available and appropriate.
    *   **Soil Health:** Improve soil structure and drainage to promote healthy root growth and reduce nematode stress.
    *   **Weed Control:** Control weeds that can act as alternative hosts for BCN (e.g., *Chenopodium album*, *Polygonum aviculare*).
*   **Curative (Limited options for seedlings):**
    *   **Nematicides:**
        *   Consider a nematicide application at planting if egg counts were high in preceeding crop and resistant varieties were not used. Follow manufacturer's guidelines and consider environmental impact. (Consult a BASIS-qualified agronomist).
	*   **NEMguard DE:** Garlic extract-based nematicide authorized for use in UK sugar beet. Apply at 10 kg/ha as near to the seed as possible during drilling. Ensure adequate soil moisture for activation (Certis Belchim Label; BBRO).
    *   **Bio-nematicides:** Some bio-nematicides may offer suppression, especially *Bacillus* based products. *Limited UK-specific efficacy data exists for Bacillus-based bio-nematicides on sugar beet. Further trials are required.* Check for efficacy data.
    *   **Fertilizer application**:
        *   Apply a nitrogen boost based on soil analysis. This will compensate for damage to the roots and help the plant establish.
	*   **Nitrogen Guidance:** Consider a conservative foliar nitrogen application, guided by soil analysis and plant tissue testing, to support seedling recovery. NDSU recommends 65 lb/A of nitrogen in the 0- to 2-foot soil depth to maximize early-season growth (NDSU, 2022 Sugarbeet Production Guide).
