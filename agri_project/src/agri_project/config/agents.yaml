As a first step in reducing the knowledge gap start by searching about the {{problem_statement.Pest}} and their permissable {{problem_statement.InfestationSeverity}}. Refer to agricultural websites and weather they have listed out any techniques for pest prevention. Also try to quote any numbers if you find related to {{problem_statement.InfestationSeverity}} so that it becomes easier for other agents to give a conclusive answer."
