## Pest Management Advice: Free-Living Nematodes in Sugar Beet

**Scenario Overview:** Early root development stage of sugar beet in Norfolk, UK, facing an infestation of *Trichodorus* nematodes at 800 nematodes/litre of soil. The weather is partly cloudy, 12Â°C, 75% humidity, with 30mm of precipitation in May.

**Identification:**

*   **Pest:** Free-living nematodes, specifically *Trichodorus* species (stubby-root nematodes). Microscopic, worm-like organisms.
*   **Identification Method:** Soil sampling and nematode extraction by a qualified lab.

**Monitoring & Thresholds:**

*   **Monitoring:** Regular soil sampling, especially in sandy soils, before and during the growing season. Visual inspection of roots for stubby root symptoms.
*   **Thresholds:** A threshold of 800 *Trichodorus* nematodes/litre of soil necessitates management intervention. Severe symptoms may occur with populations exceeding 1,000 nematodes per litre of soil (AHDB). Damage thresholds are at/above 100 nematodes in 250g soil (NET).
*   **PMD (Pest Management Decision):** True

**Damage:**

*   **Symptoms:** Stunted root growth, stubby roots, reduced water and nutrient uptake.
*   **Impact:** Yield reduction, poor sugar content, and increased susceptibility to other diseases.

**IPM Strategies:**

*   **Cultural Control:**
    *   **Crop Rotation:** Rotate with non-host crops (e.g., cereals) for at least 3 years to reduce nematode populations.
    *   **Resistant Varieties:** Select sugar beet varieties with some tolerance to nematodes (if available). Examples include Harryetta and Button (FWI). Research the AHDB Recommended List trials to assess varietal genetic potential and identify the best varieties (BBRO).
    *   **Soil Health:** Improve soil structure through organic matter amendments to enhance plant health.
*   **Chemical Control:**
    *   **Nematicides:** Consider pre-plant nematicide application if nematode pressure is high. The use of garlic-based nematicide NEMguard DE is authorized to reduce Docking disorder symptoms caused by FLN (Farming Online). Review current UK pesticide approvals on the DEFRA website.
*   **Biological Control:**
    *   **Biofumigation:** Use of brassica cover crops to suppress nematode populations.
    *   **Biocontrol Agents:** Explore the use of beneficial nematodes or fungi. Research is ongoing into the use of oyster mushrooms for biocontrol (PlantProtection.pl). Nematode-resistant catch crops can also be used (KWS).
