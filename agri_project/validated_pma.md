## Brown Planthopper (Nilaparvata lugens) Management Advice - Rice (Tamil Nadu)

**Scenario:** Rice crop at panicle initiation to booting stage in Tamil Nadu (Cauvery Delta), August (Kharif season), experiencing Brown Planthopper (BPH) infestation. Conditions: 28Â°C, overcast with intermittent showers, 85% humidity, 50 mm precipitation. Infestation: 1 hopper per hill.

**Pest Identification:**

*   **Adults:** Brown to dark brown, wedge-shaped, ~3-4 mm long.
*   **Nymphs:** Pale brown, resemble adults but smaller.
*   **Location:** Base of rice plants, near the water surface.

**Monitoring & Thresholds (PMD: True):**

*   **Regular Field Scouting:** Essential, especially during favorable weather (warm, humid).
*   **Visual Inspection:** Examine plant bases for hoppers. Look for "hopperburn" symptoms (yellowing/browning).
*   **Sweep Net:** Use a sweep net to sample insects.
*   **Economic Threshold:** 5-10 hoppers per hill at the panicle initiation to booting stage. *Note: This threshold is a general guideline. Consider factors like rice variety susceptibility, market price, and insecticide costs for a more precise assessment.*

**Damage:**

*   **Symptom:** "Hopperburn" - circular patches of yellowing and browning rice plants due to sap sucking.
*   **Impact:** Stunted growth, reduced grain filling, yield loss. Severe infestations can lead to complete crop failure.

**Integrated Pest Management (IPM) Strategies:**

*   **Cultural Practices (Critical for Prevention and Management):**
    *   **Planting Time:** Synchronized planting across the region to avoid peak BPH population build-up. Consult the local agricultural extension office for recommended planting windows.
    *   **Spacing:** Maintain adequate plant spacing (e.g., 20 cm x 15 cm) to improve air circulation and reduce humidity within the canopy, making the environment less favorable for BPH.
    *   **Water Management:** Implement Alternate Wetting and Drying (AWD) irrigation. Allow the field to dry until the soil cracks slightly before re-flooding. This reduces BPH survival. Avoid continuous flooding.
    *   **Nutrient Management:** Avoid excessive nitrogen fertilization. High nitrogen levels can increase plant susceptibility to BPH. Apply balanced fertilizers based on soil test recommendations.
    *   **Resistant Varieties:** If available and suitable for the region, consider planting BPH-resistant rice varieties. Consult with TNAU or local agricultural experts for recommendations.

*   **Biological Control (Encourage Natural Enemies):**
    *   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Encourage the presence of spiders, mirid bugs (e.g., *Cyrtorhinus lividipennis*), and parasitoids (e.g., *Anagrus* spp., *Gonatopus* spp.). Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides that harm these beneficial insects.
    *   **Habitat Management:** Provide habitats for natural enemies by maintaining field bunds and adjacent vegetation.

*   **Chemical Control (Use as a Last Resort, if Threshold Exceeded):**
    *   **Insecticide Selection:** If the economic threshold is exceeded, use selective insecticides that are less harmful to natural enemies.
    *   **Approved Insecticides (Consult Local Recommendations):**
        *   **Buprofezin:** An insect growth regulator.
        *   **Imidacloprid:** A neonicotinoid insecticide.
        *   **Fipronil:** A phenylpyrazole insecticide.
        *   *Note: Always consult the Tamil Nadu Department of Agriculture or TNAU for the latest recommendations on approved insecticides, dosages, and any restrictions. The use of certain insecticides may be restricted or phased out.*
    *   **Application:** Apply insecticides at the base of the plants, targeting the hoppers. Use appropriate spray volumes and nozzle types for effective coverage.
    *   **Rotation:** Rotate insecticides with different modes of action to prevent the development of insecticide resistance. Avoid repeated use of the same insecticide or insecticides from the same chemical group.
    *   **Application Timing:** Apply insecticides in the early morning or late evening when the temperature is cooler and the wind is calmer.

**Specific Advice for the Current Scenario (1 hopper/hill):**

*   **Monitor Closely:** Since the infestation level is currently low (1 hopper/hill), continue intensive monitoring using visual inspection and sweep nets.
*   **Implement Cultural Practices:** Focus on optimizing cultural practices, especially water management (AWD) and balanced fertilization, to create an unfavorable environment for BPH.
*   **Conserve Natural Enemies:** Avoid broad-spectrum insecticides.
*   **Prepare for Action:** Be prepared to implement chemical control if the infestation level increases and reaches the economic threshold (5-10 hoppers/hill). Have the recommended insecticides readily available.

**Additional Considerations:**

*   **Weather:** The current weather conditions (overcast, intermittent showers, high humidity) are favorable for BPH development. Continue to monitor the situation closely.
*   **Local Expertise:** Consult with local agricultural extension officers or TNAU experts for the most up-to-date information on BPH management in your specific area of Tamil Nadu. They can provide tailored advice based on local conditions and pest pressure.
