# üåæ Agricultural AI Advisor

A multi-agent AI system designed to provide comprehensive agricultural advice to farmers in India. The system addresses complex agricultural queries by coordinating specialized agents for weather analysis, crop management, market analysis, and risk assessment.

## üéØ Problem Statement

Agriculture is a high-impact area of Indian society that requires continuous innovation and experimentation with data, analytics, and AI/ML. This system addresses key challenges:

- **Multilingual Support**: Handles queries in local languages
- **Multi-modal Input**: Text, audio, and image inputs
- **Real-time Data**: Weather, market, and policy information
- **Contextual Advice**: Personalized recommendations based on farmer profile
- **Offline Capability**: Works with limited internet access
- **Explainable AI**: Provides reasoning for recommendations

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

### Multi-Agent System

The system uses CrewAI to coordinate specialized agents:

1. **Weather Agent**: Analyzes weather conditions and their impact on crops
2. **Crop Management Agent**: Provides crop-specific advice based on growth stages
3. **Market Agent**: Analyzes market conditions and pricing trends
4. **Risk Assessment Agent**: Evaluates risks and provides mitigation strategies
5. **Orchestrator Agent**: Coordinates all specialists for comprehensive advice

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- OpenAI API key (optional for demo)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd agricultural-ai-advisor
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables** (optional)
   ```bash
   # Windows
   set OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   
   # Linux/Mac
   export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   ```

4. **Run the application**
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## üìã Usage

### Test Queries

The system comes with two predefined test scenarios:

1. **Sudden Weather Change**: "The weather has suddenly changed from sunny to extremely rainy and my crops may not withstand the potential damage. What should I do?"

2. **Crop Damage Scenario**: "I have crops Wheat and Mustard. Unfortunately, due to sudden hot and dry weather for the last 5 days, 30% of Wheat could not withstand and are dead while Mustard is standing strong. Both crops' harvest cycles are 2 weeks to go. What should I do?"

### Interactive Mode

Run the system in interactive mode to test your own queries:

```bash
python main.py
# Choose option 2 for interactive mode
```

## üß™ Demo Farmer Profile

The system uses a hardcoded farmer profile for demonstration:

- **Name**: Rajesh Kumar
- **Location**: Sikandarpur, Muzaffarpur, Bihar
- **Crops**: Wheat (2 acres), Mustard (1.5 acres)
- **Experience**: 15 years
- **Financial Status**: Medium income, limited savings
- **Equipment**: Tractor, irrigation pump, sprayer, harvester

## üîß Configuration

### Farmer Context (KHC Data)

Edit `config.py` to modify the farmer profile:

```python
FARMER_CONTEXT = {
    "name": "Rajesh Kumar",
    "location": {
        "village": "Sikandarpur",
        "district": "Muzaffarpur", 
        "state": "Bihar",
        "coordinates": {"lat": 26.1209, "lng": 85.3647}
    },
    "crops": [
        {
            "name": "Wheat",
            "area": "2 acres",
            "current_stage": "flowering",
            "health_status": "good"
        }
    ],
    # ... more configuration
}
```

### API Integration

The system supports real API integration for:

- **Weather Data**: OpenWeatherMap API
- **Market Data**: Agricultural market APIs
- **Policy Data**: Government scheme APIs

Configure APIs in `config.py`:

```python
WEATHER_API_CONFIG = {
    "base_url": "https://api.openweathermap.org/data/2.5/",
    "api_key": os.getenv("WEATHER_API_KEY", "")
}
```
